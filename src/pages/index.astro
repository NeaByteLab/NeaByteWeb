					<p>
						Welcome to the <strong>NeaByteLab</strong> website, a simple site built with Astro JS.
					</p>
					<p>
						NeaByteLab is my personal initiative, where I focus on creating high-performance tools, experimenting with innovative technologies, and delivering solutions that solve real-world problems. The work spans software engineering, automation, trading systems, and cybersecurity â€” all with a strong emphasis on clean, efficient, and scalable development.
					</p>
					<p>
						The core mission of NeaByteLab is to share knowledge and technology through open-source projects. From developer utilities and API services to static site generators and security tools, every project reflects a commitment to quality, accessibility, and continuous learning.
					</p>
					<p>
						My vision is to build technology that not only pushes boundaries but also inspires others to learn, contribute, and innovate. I believe that collaboration and transparency are key to meaningful progress in the tech community.
					</p>
					<p>
						While this site itself contains no content or projects at the moment, you can explore everything Iâ€™m building and contributing to on GitHub.
